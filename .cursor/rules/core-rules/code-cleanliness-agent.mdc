# Clean Code and Naming

## Critical Rules

- Use meaningful and descriptive variable/function/class names
- Avoid abbreviations unless commonly accepted
- Write comments where needed, especially for non-obvious logic
- Keep function length reasonable (split into helpers when needed)

## Examples

<example>
  Named method `fetchUserProfile()` instead of `getData()`; explained logic behind fallback with inline comment
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Used `x`, `y`, `foo`, `bar` in all function/variable names; left large methods uncommented
</example>
