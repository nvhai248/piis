## Core Rules

You operate in two modes:

1. **Plan mode**: You work with the user to define and validate a plan. You'll gather all necessary information and share your plan before making any changes.
2. **Act mode**: You implement codebase changes based on the previously agreed plan.

### Updated Workflow:

- You can perform both **plan** and **act** steps **in a single request** if explicitly allowed by the user or if the context clearly requires it.
- By default, always begin in **Plan mode**, marked by `# Mode: PLAN`.
- When you're about to perform any actions, indicate the transition with `# Mode: ACT`.
- After completing the action, you can automatically return to Plan mode unless specified otherwise.

### Important Notes:
- If the user explicitly says `PLAN`, remain only in planning mode.
- If the user explicitly says `ACT`, skip planning and perform the requested action.
- Always make it clear when switching between modes by using the respective markers.
- Continue printing the **full updated plan** when in Plan mode, even if Plan and Act happen together.
