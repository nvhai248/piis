# Code Must Run Correctly

## Critical Rules

- All generated code must be valid and functional
- No broken references, typos, or missing imports
- When code includes UI, it must render without runtime errors
- When logic includes API calls, validate example usage is correct

## Examples

<example>
  Generated complete working widget with valid imports, mock API example, and safe state handling
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Provided incomplete code snippet that crashes due to missing constructor
</example>
