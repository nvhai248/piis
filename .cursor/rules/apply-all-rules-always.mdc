# Apply All Relevant Rules

## Critical Rules

- Always check for applicable rules across all `.cursor/rules/**` folders before generating code or giving suggestions
- Apply **every rule** that matches by filename, description, or glob pattern
- When generating code or fixing bugs, **ensure consistency** by checking:
  - Code style and naming conventions
  - Folder and file structure patterns
  - Exception handling logic
  - UI/UX responsiveness and modern design
  - Dependency management instructions
  - Clean comments and readability
- If a rule includes both a `description` and examples, use that context to make a confident decision
- Never ignore existing rules in `.cursor/rules/` — always respect them

## Examples

<example>
  A user asks for a new Supabase auth widget → agent checks `supabase-rules`, `flutter-rules`, `ui-rules`, and `core-rules` and applies component structure, error handling, and modern UI rules
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Agent generates code without applying naming rules, no exception handling, and forgets to check folder placement conventions from `flutter-rules`
</example>
