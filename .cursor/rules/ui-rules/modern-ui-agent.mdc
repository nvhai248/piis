# Modern and Responsive UI

## Critical Rules

- Use modern and accessible color schemes
- Layout should be visually comfortable and balanced
- Ensure full responsiveness (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Avoid hard-coded dimensions; prefer `Flexible`, `Expanded`, or media queries

## Examples

<example>
  Used responsive layout with `LayoutBuilder` and `MediaQuery` to build a mobile-first dashboard UI with modern colors
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Hard-coded container widths and default Material colors on every widget, causing broken layout on smaller screens
</example>
