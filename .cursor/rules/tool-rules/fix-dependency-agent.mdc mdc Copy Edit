# Fixing Dependencies and Setup Issues

## Critical Rules

- Include every needed CLI step (e.g., `flutter pub get`, `dart run build_runner`)
- Clearly describe what was changed and why
- If new tools are needed, mention installation

## Examples

<example>
  When adding `freezed`, included `flutter pub add freezed_annotation` and `flutter pub run build_runner build`
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Only updated `pubspec.yaml` but did not mention required code generation step, resulting in broken build
</example>
